# SQL Analysis Scripts

This folder contains SQL scripts used to analyze Rockbuster Stealth business data as part of a simulated Business Intelligence engagement.

Each script represents a different analytical layer of the project:

| Script | Business Question Answered |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 01_customer_distribution_by_country.sql | Where are Rockbuster customers located globally? |
| 02_city_country_customer_segments.sql | Which cities and countries represent the strongest customer clusters? |
| 03_customer_lifetime_value.sql | What is the lifetime revenue value of Rockbuster customers by market? |
| 04_top_customer_market_power.sql | How concentrated is revenue among top customers and which countries rely on “whale” customers? |

Together, these scripts model a real-world BI workflow:  
global distribution → segmentation → lifetime value → revenue risk assessment.
